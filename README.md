# EDA and Predictive Modeling on Datasets

This project demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Predictive Modeling** techniques on various datasets. The goal is to uncover insights from the data through visualization, statistical analysis, and build machine learning models to predict outcomes based on the dataset. The project showcases the step-by-step process of working with real-world datasets, performing EDA, and applying machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, distributions, and relationships between variables through visualizations and statistical methods.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building machine learning models to predict target variables, including models like **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and more.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1 Score**, and **Confusion Matrix** to evaluate the model performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, you need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running notebooks directly)
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

- ## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Load and preview the data.
- Check for missing values and data types.
- Visualize distributions of features using histograms, box plots, and pair plots.
- Identify relationships between features using correlation heatmaps.
- Analyze outliers and trends.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing data (impute or drop).
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- Scale/normalize numerical features.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Choose appropriate machine learning models based on the problem (regression, classification).
- Train multiple models (e.g., **Random Forest**, **Linear Regression**, **KNN**, etc.).
- Tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
- Evaluate models using relevant metrics (e.g., **Accuracy**, **F1 Score**, etc.).

### 4. Model Evaluation and Results
- Compare the performance of different models using cross-validation.
- Visualize model performance with confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc.
- Analyze feature importance (in case of tree-based models).

## Datasets

The project uses several publicly available datasets for analysis. Some popular datasets might include:

- **Iris Dataset** (classification problem)
- **Boston Housing Dataset** (regression problem)
- **Titanic Dataset** (classification problem)

You can find these datasets on platforms like **Kaggle** or use your own dataset for the analysis.

## Results

The results will typically include:
- Insights from the EDA phase.
- Visualizations of key relationships in the data.
- A trained machine learning model with its evaluation metrics.
- Any insights or conclusions drawn based on the model performance.
