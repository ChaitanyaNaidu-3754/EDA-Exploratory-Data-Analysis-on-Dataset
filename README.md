🚀 Unveiling Insights with Exploratory Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling!

I’m excited to share my latest project: EDA and Predictive Modeling on Datasets, a Flask-based web application that automates data analysis and model training. This project aims to streamline the entire data science workflow—from data ingestion and visualization to machine learning predictions—all through an intuitive web interface.

🔍 What This Project Does
This application allows users to upload datasets in CSV format and automatically performs:
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations.
✅ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical data.
✅ Predictive Modeling: Training ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and KNN.
✅ Model Evaluation: Assessing performance with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, R², and MSE.
✅ AI-powered Image Interpretation: Utilizing OpenCV & GPT-2 to analyze generated visualizations.

⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ Upload a dataset 📂
2️⃣ The app performs EDA and generates visual insights 📊
3️⃣ It suggests a target variable for prediction 🎯
4️⃣ Select a machine learning model 🤖
5️⃣ The system trains and evaluates the model, displaying the results 🚀

🔗 Tech Stack
🛠 Flask (for the web app)
📊 Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib (for data analysis & visualization)
🤖 Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)
📸 OpenCV (for image processing)
💡 GPT-2 (for AI-generated insights)

This project is a step towards making automated data analysis accessible to everyone. Whether you're a data enthusiast, student, or professional—this tool simplifies the entire ML pipeline in a few clicks!
